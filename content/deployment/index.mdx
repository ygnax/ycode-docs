# Deployment

<Callout type="info">
  **Using Ycode Cloud?** Deployment is handled automatically. Your site is hosted and managed by Ycode. You can still configure custom domains and redirects from your project settings.
</Callout>

This section covers deployment for the Open Source self-hosted version. Ycode deploys on Vercel with Supabase as the backend.

## Setup Wizard

New Open Source installations use a setup wizard at `/ycode/welcome`. The wizard guides you through:

- Connecting to Supabase
- Running database migrations
- Creating your admin account

Complete the wizard before publishing.

## Publishing Flow

Content uses a draft-to-published workflow. This works the same in both Cloud and Open Source:

1. Edit pages, components, and CMS content in draft mode
2. Preview changes in the editor
3. Click **Publish** when ready
4. Published content goes live on your site

Draft changes are not visible to visitors until you publish. You can unpublish to revert to the previous published state.

## Cache Revalidation

For Open Source deployments, configure a `REVALIDATE_SECRET` environment variable in Vercel. When content is published, Ycode triggers revalidation so the live site reflects updates quickly.

## Custom Domains

Connect your own domain to your Ycode site.

[Custom domains documentation](/docs/deployment/custom-domains)

## Redirects

Manage URL redirects for moved pages, vanity URLs, and legacy paths.
