# Getting Started

Learn how to set up Ycode and build your first website.

## Choose Your Path

Ycode is available as a managed cloud service or as open-source software you host yourself. The features are the same -- the only difference is how you get started.

### Ycode Cloud

Sign up at [ycode.com](https://www.ycode.com) and start building immediately. No server setup, no environment variables, no deployments to manage. Ycode Cloud handles hosting, updates, and infrastructure for you.

Best for:
- Teams and individuals who want to start quickly
- Non-technical users
- Projects where you prefer managed hosting

### Ycode Open Source

Fork the repository, deploy on your own Vercel + Supabase infrastructure, and have full control over the code and data. You can customize anything and contribute back to the project.

Best for:
- Developers who want full control
- Custom deployments and self-hosting
- Contributing to the project

<Callout type="info">
  The installation and configuration guides in this section cover the **Open Source** setup. If you are using **Ycode Cloud**, you can skip straight to [Your First Project](/docs/getting-started/first-project) after signing up.
</Callout>

## What You Need

**For Ycode Cloud:** Just a web browser and an account at [ycode.com](https://www.ycode.com).

**For Ycode Open Source:**
- Node.js 18 or later
- A Supabase project (free tier works)
- Git and npm
- A Vercel account (for production deployment)

## Next Steps

1. [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) -- Deploy to Vercel or run locally (Open Source)
2. [Configuration](/docs/getting-started/configuration) -- Environment variables and Supabase (Open Source)
3. [Your First Project](/docs/getting-started/first-project) -- Create a page and use the editor (both Cloud and Open Source)
