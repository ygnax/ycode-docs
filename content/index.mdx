# Ycode Documentation

Welcome to Ycode. Ycode is a visual website builder that gives you full control over your site. Think of it as an alternative to Wix or Squarespace, but one that you can self-host or use as a managed cloud service. You get a drag-and-drop editor, a built-in CMS, forms, and more.

## Open Source or Cloud -- your choice

Ycode is available in two ways:

**Ycode Cloud** -- Go to [ycode.com](https://www.ycode.com) and sign up. No setup required. You get a fully managed instance with hosting, updates, and support included. Best for teams and individuals who want to start building immediately.

**Ycode Open Source** -- Fork the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ygnax/ycode), deploy on your own Vercel + Supabase infrastructure, and own everything. Best for developers who want full control, customization, or to contribute to the project.

<Callout type="info">
  Both versions share the same core features. The editor, CMS, forms, localization, and all other capabilities described in this documentation apply to both Ycode Cloud and Ycode Open Source.
